# helios - Lighting Scenario Laboratory 
Our goal is to achieve the best mixing light for portraiting by shooting images testing with many different light configurations.
The result is a matrix of pictures to compare the best lighting configuration,  check sensor meassurements (distance, etc) to help portrating amateurs optimizing the scene.

# Features
1. New/load/save scenarios with different configurations 
2. Compose scenario lighting by configuring different DMX512 lighting Luminaires 
3. Define different light transitions (Scenes) with different brightness, color temperature (cct), rgb 
4. Define camera shooting configuration and sensors

# Process
1. Architect > Describe scenario

2.
